    <h1 style = "text-align: center;"> Andy's Own Website </h1>

    <p style = "text-align: center;"> Hello World, welcome to the universe! And welcome to my very first website page!!</p>

    <p style = "text-align: center;">  My name is Andy, and I love math. </p>

    <h1 style = "text-align: center;"> I am 12 years old!!</h1>

    <img src = "The Golden Ratio.jpeg" alt = "The Golden Ratio" style = "width:35%;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;display:block;border: 5px solid red;">

    <p style = "text-align: center;"><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> is the best!</p>

    <p style = "text-align: center;"> Here's a little more about me: I am in grade 7 this year, and I go to Shaughnessy Elementary School. I am also passionate about tennis, and I now play once a week at Richmond Country Club. </p>

    <p style = "text-align: center;"> In addition, I play the piano and the clarinet. Here's a picture of a grand piano: </p>

    <h1 style = "text-align: center;"> In my spare time, I like to read a lot, and sometimes play video games as well!</h1>

    <p style = "text-align: center;">Also, I watch YouTube, and my favourite youtuber right now is probably MrBeast(WARNING: TOTALLY NOT AN ADVERTISEMENT). If you're interested, here is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA">MrBeast's YouTube link. </a></p>


    <p style = "text-align: center;">He also does a separate gaming channel on YouTube, here is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIPPMRA040LQr5QPyJEbmXA"> the link. </a></p>


    <p style = "text-align: center;"> MrBeast does a lot of crazy (but fun) stuff in his videos, anything you can imagine! Here is one of my favourite: </p>

    <p style = "text-align:center;"> I will add more stuff to this amazing website in the future, but I just wanted to say huge thanks to Ansel, my coding tutor, as well as two other epic websites called <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> and <a href = "https://www.programiz.com/">Programiz</a></p>

    <p style = "text-align: center;">And also, you can't forget <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>! :)</p>

    <p style = "text-align:center;"> For helping me build this fascinating website and teaching me new things about the fascinating world of coding! </p>

    <p style = "text-align:center;"> Ok! Now that's said, I will think of new ideas to add on here. However, if any of you guys have any suggestions to add on my website (though I'm pretty sure nobody else can see this), feel free to e-mail me at andyhu.you@gmail.com</p>
